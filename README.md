# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains applied machine learning projects developed as part of my MSc Data Science program and AI Engineering Fellowship. The focus is on classical and modern machine learning techniques, covering the full pipeline from data preparation to model evaluation.

Projects here demonstrate practical experience in building, training, and evaluating machine learning models using real-world and structured datasets.

> Generative AI and LLM-based systems are maintained in a separate repository.

## Problem Domains
The projects span multiple applied domains, including:
- Predictive analytics
- Classification and regression problems
- Pattern discovery using unsupervised learning
- Data-driven decision support

## Machine Learning Techniques
- Supervised learning (regression, classification)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation and error analysis

## Workflow
Each project typically follows a structured ML workflow:
1. Problem definition
2. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation and interpretation
6. Iterative improvement

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Git & GitHub

## Repository Structure
- Individual project folders or notebooks
- Dataset preprocessing scripts
- Model training and evaluation notebooks
- Experimentation and analysis files

## Learning Outcomes
- Built reproducible machine learning pipelines
- Developed intuition for bias–variance trade-offs
- Improved model performance through feature engineering
- Strengthened applied problem-solving skills in ML systems

## Notes
This repository focuses strictly on **machine learning projects**.

Advanced **AI systems, generative models, LLM-based applications, and production APIs** are available in a separate dedicated repository.
